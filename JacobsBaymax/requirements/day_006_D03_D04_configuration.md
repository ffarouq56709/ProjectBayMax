# Day 6 · The first working configuration

**R0.3 · 2026-10-28 · Owner: Faisal Farouq**
Day 6 result: **PASS** (configuration document). Owner accepted the recommendations on 2026-10-28. D-03 and D-04 are the modelling basis; they stay provisional until the G2 review.
Nothing here has been built, simulated or tested. Every number is a target, a listing or a hand calculation, and is labelled that way.

## The short version

| Part | R0.2 proposal | R0.3 recommendation | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Legs | 5 joints per leg, no hip yaw, both ankle axes | **Keep. 10 joints.** | Flat-foot side-to-side weight shift needs a roll joint at both hip and ankle. Yaw is not needed for straight-line steps. |
| Hip width | Not set (feet 0.34 m apart) | **Hip-roll axes 0.30 m apart, inside wide thigh shells** | Hip roll carries the biggest load: 80.9 N m static at 0.30 m, 97.1 N m at the photo's apparent 0.36 m. Wide shells keep the photo's stance. |
| Drives | Not selected | **Screen a 120 N m-peak module class, with a 3:1 stage on hip roll and 2:1 on knee** | Direct drives fail the rated-torque screen at hip roll and knee. These stages pass it at up to 0.36 m spacing. |
| Head | Fixed | **Keep fixed** | No powered axis is needed for a fixed camera, speaker and face. |
| Arms and hands | Passive | **Arms pinned during walking; hands sculpted and fixed** | A free-swinging arm is an unmodelled pendulum. The photo's fingered hands become later scope. |
| Handling | One-axis carriage on two guides, custom drive | **Keep one axis. Use a bought guided linear actuator with a datasheet holding force, on its own stand.** | It is cheaper, has a known load rating, and moves 2.5 kg off the walking robot. |
| Axes | 10 + 1 = 11 | **10 + 1 = 11 (unchanged)** | |
| Mass | ≤55 kg target, 47.8 kg allocated | **Projection 48.5 kg + 6.5 kg reserve; shell is a risk** | Drives add 3.3 kg; the handling stand removes 2.6 kg. The photo's bulky shell may add about 1.6 kg more. |
| Cash | $10,000 cap; $15,000 scenario | **Actuator line now screens at $2,841–3,481 against a $3,000 pool** | Current listings are far below the R0.1 reference. They are not quotes. |

## Inputs I used

- `requirements/day_006_D03_D04_configuration.md` R0.2 (archived in `revision_history/day_006_revised_proposal_R0_2.zip`)
- `cad_specifications/parameters.json` and `candidate_joints.csv` (R0.1)
- `budget/mass_budget.csv`, `budget/financial_budget.csv` (R0.1)
- `requirements/day_005_D01_budget_options.md` (R0.2, PASS for arithmetic)
- `release_archive/R0_1/Jacobs_Baymax_Engineering_Baseline_R0_1.pdf` pp. 6–8 (load, mass and handling screens)
- New calculation: `architecture/day_006_joint_load_screen.py` → `day_006_joint_load_screen.csv`, `day_006_actuator_screen.csv`

## Appearance reference

Reference: `cad_specifications/reference/baymax-rigid-panel-concept-v1.png` (concept render supplied 2026-10-28; not a drawing). Scale estimate: 1.829 m ≈ 663 px, so ≈ 2.8 mm per px. The render is in perspective, so read every dimension as ±20%.

| Feature in the photo | Engineering consequence |
|---|---|
| Small egg-shaped head on a charcoal collar, two eyes joined by a line | Fixed head; face can be printed or a small display. Speaker and microphone fit in the collar. |
| Very wide shoulders and torso | Shell area likely 3–4 m², above the 2.5 m² assumption. At 1.5 mm and 1,050 kg/m³: 3.5 m² → 5.5 kg + 1.26 kg mounts = **6.8 kg vs 5.2 kg allocated**. |
| Legs set wide, about 0.30–0.38 m between centres | Drives hip-roll torque (table below). Wide thigh shells can hide hip axes set slightly inboard. |
| Chest window with two lenses and a teal light | Fits a stereo/depth camera and a status light. Keep the window clear of the handling tray. |
| Fingered hands | Year one: sculpted, fixed hands with no motors. |
| Charcoal knee pads and exposed ankle joints | Matches the protected charcoal joint gaps in JB-R-010. Check pinch gaps on Day 97. |
| Vents on the thighs and hips | Good places for actuator cooling air. Confirm on Day 124. |
| Broad flat shoes with dark soles | Matches the 0.32 × 0.22 m feet. Sole material is a friction question (Day 117). |

## D-03 · Legs: keep ten joints, no hip yaw

**Frontal-plane check.** To shift weight sideways with both feet flat, each leg tilts by the same angle φ. The hip must roll by −φ and the ankle by +φ. Without ankle roll the sole tips onto its edge. Option C (yaw instead of ankle roll) therefore cannot do a flat-foot weight shift. Robots without ankle roll walk dynamically on a narrow contact instead. Unitree's H1 lists five leg joints with one ankle joint; its successor H1-2 lists two ankle joints per leg ([Unitree H1 page](https://www.unitree.com/h1), checked 2026-10-28). That is a design data point, not proof for this robot.

**Yaw check.** Without hip yaw the feet keep the pelvis heading. Straight-line steps do not need yaw. The stance foot resists the swing leg's yaw reaction by friction. Screen: μ = 0.5 (assumed, unmeasured) × 539.55 N × 0.104 m mean contact radius = **28.2 N m** of yaw capacity. The swing reaction must be checked in simulation (Day 159, Day 171). Turning stays out of year one (JB-R-055).

**Alternatives, costed.**

| Option | Joints | Lower-body actuator cost (listing, unquoted) | Mass effect | Verdict |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| A · roll/pitch hip, knee, pitch/roll ankle | 10 | $2,841–3,481 (below) | +3.3 kg vs allocation | **Recommend** |
| B · add hip yaw | 12 | +2 small modules ≈ +$448–638 | +1.8–2.8 kg | Breaks JB-R-005. Needed only for turning. |
| C · yaw replaces ankle roll | 10 | same as A | same as A | Loses flat-foot lateral shift. Reject for year one. |

**Gait method.** Plan a ZMP preview-control gait (Kajita et al., 2003). Reaching 0.10–0.15 m/s needs steps of about 1.2 s, which is too fast for a purely static gait. Linear-inverted-pendulum screen: centre-of-mass height 1.0 m (assumed), sway frequency 2.62 rad/s, gain 1.70. A lateral sway of **0.100 m** puts the ZMP at the foot centre (0.17 m). Step length at 1.2 s: **0.120 m** for 0.10 m/s, **0.180 m** for 0.15 m/s. Three steps covering 0.45 m take **3.0–4.5 s**.

## Loads: where the torque goes

Hand screen, single support, 55 kg robot, 10 kg per leg, 35 kg above the hips. Dynamic multiplier 1.5 is the R0.1 illustrative value, not a design factor.

| Joint | Case | Static N m | ×1.5 N m |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Hip roll | hip spacing 0.36 m (photo) | **97.1** | 145.7 |
| Hip roll | hip spacing 0.34 m (R0.1 feet) | **91.7** | 137.6 |
| Hip roll | hip spacing 0.30 m (recommended) | **80.9** | 121.4 |
| Hip roll | hip spacing 0.24 m (narrow) | **64.7** | 97.1 |
| Knee pitch | knee bent 0.5 rad | 51.7 | 77.5 |
| Knee pitch | knee bent 0.7 rad | 71.6 | 107.4 |
| Hip pitch | torso held 0.05 m forward | 17.2 | 25.8 |
| Ankle pitch | ZMP 0.06 m from ankle | 32.4 | 48.6 |
| Ankle roll | ZMP 0.04 m from ankle | 21.6 | 32.4 |

Formula for hip roll: τ = g(m_upper × s/2 + m_leg × s), where s is hip spacing. The R0.1 screen (35 kg × 0.15 m = 51.5 N m) left out the swing leg and **underestimates hip roll by 13–46 N m**. Ankle torque cannot usefully exceed weight × distance to the sole edge: 107.9 N m (toe), 64.7 N m (heel), 59.4 N m (side).

## Drives and cost

| Module (listing, checked 2026-10-28) | Rated / peak N m | Mass | Price seen | Passes hip roll at 0.30 m (80.9 static)? |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| RobStride 04 | 40 / 120 | 1.42 kg | $255 ([aifitlab](https://aifitlab.com/products/robstride-04-motor)); from $319 ([rcdrone](https://rcdrone.top/collections/robstride)) | Peak yes; **rated no** |
| RobStride 04 + 2:1 stage (concept) | 76 / 228 | 1.77 kg | +$50 per stage (assumed) | No (passes knee) |
| RobStride 04 + 3:1 stage (concept) | 114 / 342 | 1.87 kg | +$50 per stage (assumed) | **Yes, up to 0.36 m** |
| CubeMars AK80-64 | 48 / 120 | 0.85 kg | $1,150.76 ([RobotShop](https://www.robotshop.com/products/cubemars-ak80-64-kv80-ak-series-robotic-actuator)) | Peak yes; rated no |
| RobStride 03 | 20 / 60 | 0.88 kg | from $224 | No |

RobStride 04 rated torque is 40 N m with a 345 × 345 mm heat sink and 35 N m with a smaller one ([openelab guide](https://openelab.io/blogs/learn/what-is-robstride04-120nm-qdd-high-torque-robot-joints)). A leg gives it far less cooling, so the thermal check on Days 110 and 124 matters.

**Actuator line, R0.3 screen (unquoted):**

```text
10 x $255 + 4 x $50 stage + $91.25 USB-CAN hub = $2,841
10 x $319 + 4 x $50 stage + $91.25 USB-CAN hub = $3,481
R0.1 pool under the $10,000 cap                 = $3,000
Project total with R0.1 non-actuator lines     = $9,841 – $10,481
```

This replaces the R0.1 reference total of $15,899. It does **not** prove the cap works. The $7,000 of non-actuator allowances are still unquoted and look thin: $650 for structure and fabrication, $1,000 for rated robot fall protection, $600 for engineering review. Shipping, tax and import duty are unknown.

## Mass projection

| Line | R0.1 kg | R0.3 kg | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| M-02 ten drives, transmissions, mounts | 14.0 | 17.3 | 10 × 1.42 + 2 × 0.45 (3:1) + 2 × 0.35 (2:1) + 10 × 0.15 mount (stage and mount masses assumed) |
| M-09 handling module | 3.0 | 0.4 | Docking plate only; the stand and actuator move off the robot (assumed) |
| Other lines | 30.8 | 30.8 | unchanged |
| **Components** | **47.8** | **48.5** | +0.7 |
| Reserve to 55 kg | 7.2 | **6.5** | |
| Risk not yet in the projection: bulky shell | | +1.6 | Reserve would fall to 4.9 kg |

The handling configuration still counts everything attached to the robot. The stand, actuator, tray and 2 kg object are listed separately (JB-R-003 note in `budget/06_mass_budget.md`).

## Head and arms

- **Head:** fixed. It holds the connected-eye face, speaker, microphone with a hardware privacy switch, and a camera. No powered head axis in year one.
- **Arms:** unpowered and **pinned** at the shoulder during every gait trial. A removable pin lets you pose them for photos. The 2.0 kg M-10 allocation is unchanged.
- **Hands:** sculpted and fixed. The photo's fingers are cosmetic in year one.

## D-04 · Handling: one axis, bought, on its own stand

Keep the R0.2 idea: one vertical axis, retained tray, robot secured and stationary. Change how it is built.

| Item | Recommendation | Evidence to collect |
|---|---|---|
| Drive | Commercial guided linear actuator or screw stage, ≥100 mm stroke, with a **datasheet static holding force** or integral brake | Datasheet page showing holding force, duty cycle and limit switches |
| Load to hold | Object 19.62 N + tray and carriage (≈0.5 kg assumed, 4.91 N) = **24.5 N** | Weighed tray and carriage |
| Screen | Datasheet holding force ≥ 4 × 24.5 N = **98 N** (screening ratio assumed, for a reviewer to confirm) | Reviewer's written ratio |
| Moment at 0.30 m reach | 2 × 9.81 × 0.30 = **5.886 N m** object only | Bracket check by a mechanical reviewer |
| Stand | Separate floor stand, positioned so the tray sits in front of the robot's chest | Stand drawing; tip-over check |
| Robot | Secured to its support frame, walking disabled | Interlock test (Day 299) |

Power-loss behaviour: a lead screw is **not** assumed self-locking. Use the datasheet holding rating or a brake. B-08 stays at $350 unquoted.

## Sensing (unchanged from R0.2)

10 output-side joint encoders · 1 pelvis IMU · 8 foot load channels (4 per foot) · 1 tether load cell · 2 reference cameras (side, front) · handling position, current, temperature and retained-object switch. These are analysis quantities. Nothing is selected or owned.

## What changed from R0.2, and what it costs

| Change | Joints | Mass | Scope | Cash |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hip axes 0.30 m apart under wide shells | none | none | CAD task added to Days 86, 93 | none |
| 3:1 stage on hip roll, 2:1 on knee | none | +1.6 kg | adds 4 stage assemblies to fabricate | +$200 assumed |
| Listing-based drive class | none | +1.7 kg vs allocation | | actuator line $2,841–3,481 vs R0.1 $8,899 |
| Fixed sculpted hands | none | inside M-10 | articulated hands moved to later scope | none |
| Arms pinned for gait | none | none | pin detail on Day 87 | ≈$0 |
| Bought handling actuator on a stand | handling axis still 1 | −2.6 kg on robot | stand added to Day 201 drawings | within B-08 $350 (unquoted) |

## Decisions for Day 7

1. **D-03:** accept Option A (10 joints, no yaw) for further modelling. Yes / change.
2. **Hip spacing and drives:** (a) hip axes 0.30 m apart under wide shells, 3:1 on hip roll, 2:1 on knee — keeps the photo's look (recommended); or (b) 0.24 m with 2:1 on both — lighter load, visibly narrower stance.
3. **D-04:** accept the bought guided actuator on its own stand as the primary handling concept. Yes / change.
4. **D-01:** keep $10,000 as the working cap until quotes arrive (Days 188–193), with $15,000 as the fallback scenario. Or set the ceiling now.

## When you need outside help

| Topic | When | Ask for | Evidence to keep |
|---|---|---|---|
| Joint loads and drive choice | Day 112 | A mechanical or robotics engineer to check `day_110_joint_duty_summary.csv` | Written comments with name, date and file revision |
| Hip and knee 2:1 stage | Day 199 | Structural check of belt or gear stage brackets | Marked-up drawing or calculation sign-off |
| Handling stand and holding force | Day 296 | Mechanical reviewer to confirm the holding ratio and stand stability | Signed note with ratio and drawing revision |

No reviewer is named yet. Day 4 lists all six specialist roles as UNASSIGNED.
